i had a lot of fun with this project. thank you
aurora, megan and tim for giving me the opportunity to
push on to mod2! just this morning i figured out how to use
stubs in my program. i'm very happy how many things have
become less confusing in the past couple weeks. i hope you all are
enjoying the week off.
