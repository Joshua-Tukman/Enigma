I had a lot of fun with this project. Thank you
Aurora, Megan and Tim for giving me the opportunity to
push on to MOD2! Just this morning I figured out how to use
Stubs in my program with the key value. Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to figure out how to use it with the date value. For some reason
it would revert back to today's date.
Overall, I'm very happy with how many things have
become less confusing in the past couple weeks. I hope you all are
enjoying the week off.
