I had a lot of fun with this project. Thank you
Aurora, Megan and Tim for giving me the opportunity to
push on to MOD2! Just this morning I figured out how to use
Stubs in my program. I'm very happy how many things have
become less confusing in the past couple weeks. I hope you all are
enjoying the week off.
